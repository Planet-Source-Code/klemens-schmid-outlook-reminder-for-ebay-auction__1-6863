## Outlook reminder for eBay auction


</div>

### Description

Functionality:<br>

This macro creates an Outlook appointment for the eBay auction you are currently looking at in your browser (IE). It extracts the auction's end date and sets the reminder accordingly. The macro supports www.ebay.com and www.ebay.de. 

You can also use it to create appoinments for other Web pages but without setting the date automatically.

New: Now supports the latest eBay page layout and automatically transforms the auctions end time to your machine's time zone.

<br>Prerequisites:<br>

You need Microsoft Outlook 2000 for this function because only this supports VBA. You also need IE 4 or later.

<br>Installation:<br>

The ZIP file you get from the download contains two VBA files. These must both be added to your VBA project. Additionally you have to add the references for "Microsoft HTML Object Library" and "Microsoft Internet Controls". For more details see http://www.schmidks.de/klemens/install_vba.htm
